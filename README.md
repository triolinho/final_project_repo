# Project Goals

  Soccer is the most popular sport in the world, and European soccer has the most prestigious teams in the world. But many fans focus their attention on one league and have a favorite team in that league. This project aims to broaden horizons and suggest teams in the other European Leagues.
  
  Take a team from one of the top five European Leagues -- English Premier League, French Ligue 1, Italian Serie A, German Bundesliga, and Spanish La Liga -- and return the most similar team from each of the other four teams.
  
  Then simulate a series of games in each matchup to see how your team would fare against the other four
